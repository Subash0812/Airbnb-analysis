#  Airbnb Analysis  

##  Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Airbnb data** using **MongoDB Atlas, Python, Streamlit, and Power BI** to uncover insights into pricing trends, seasonal availability, and location-based patterns.  
The goal is to build an **end-to-end data pipeline** â€“ from data retrieval and cleaning to interactive dashboards â€“ enabling **data-driven decisions** in the travel and tourism industry.  

---

## Objectives  
- Establish a **MongoDB Atlas** connection and retrieve Airbnb dataset.  
- Perform **data cleaning & preprocessing** (handle missing values, duplicates, type conversions).  
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python Notebook.  
- Build a **Streamlit web app** for interactive maps and charts.  
- Perform **geospatial analysis** to explore listing distributions.  
- Analyze **pricing variations** by location, property type, and season.  
- Explore **availability patterns** and demand fluctuations.  
- Create an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to present insights.  

---

##  Skills & Tools  
- **Programming & Analysis**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL data retrieval & queries)  
- **Visualization**: Streamlit (interactive web app), Power BI (dashboard)  
- **Domain**: Travel Industry, Property Management, Tourism

## Dataset  
The dataset comes from **MongoDB Atlas Airbnb data**, including details about listings, hosts, neighborhoods, prices, availability, ratings, and reviews.  

### Example JSON structure:  
```json
{
  "_id": "unique_listing_id",
  "name": "listing_title",
  "description": "listing_description",
  "host_id": "unique_host_id",
  "host_name": "host_name",
  "neighbourhood": "neighbourhood_name",
  "location": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [longitude, latitude]
  },
  "price": "listing_price",
  "availability": {
    "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD"
  },
  "amenities": ["amenity_1", "amenity_2"],
  "rating": "average_rating",
  "reviews": [
    {
      "reviewer_id": "unique_reviewer_id",
      "reviewer_name": "reviewer_name",
      "comment": "review_comment",
      "rating": "review_rating"
    }
  ]
}
```
