#  Airbnb Analysis  

##  Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Airbnb data** using **MongoDB Atlas, Python, Streamlit, and Power BI** to uncover insights into pricing trends, seasonal availability, and location-based patterns.  
The goal is to build an **end-to-end data pipeline** – from data retrieval and cleaning to interactive dashboards – enabling **data-driven decisions** in the travel and tourism industry.  

---

## Objectives  
- Establish a **MongoDB Atlas** connection and retrieve Airbnb dataset.  
- Perform **data cleaning & preprocessing** (handle missing values, duplicates, type conversions).  
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python Notebook.  
- Build a **Streamlit web app** for interactive maps and charts.  
- Perform **geospatial analysis** to explore listing distributions.  
- Analyze **pricing variations** by location, property type, and season.  
- Explore **availability patterns** and demand fluctuations.  
- Create an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to present insights.  

---

##  Skills & Tools  
- **Programming & Analysis**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (NoSQL data retrieval & queries)  
- **Visualization**: Streamlit (interactive web app), Power BI (dashboard)  
- **Domain**: Travel Industry, Property Management, Tourism

## Dataset  
The dataset comes from **MongoDB Atlas Airbnb data**, including details about listings, hosts, neighborhoods, prices, availability, ratings, and reviews.
